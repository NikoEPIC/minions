<h2>QUOTES:</h2>

<h2>”When the President does it, that means that it is not illegal.”</h2>

<h2>”Defeat doesn't finish a man, quit does. A man is not finished when he's defeated. He's finished when he quits.”</h2>

<h2>”People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I earned everything I've got.”</h2>
